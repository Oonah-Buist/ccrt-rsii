CCRT RSII Initiative
It isn’t possible… until it is
ARC ParadigmTM
an initiative focused on normal health in cancer
Focusing on your underlying health
Supporting intrinsic health in a body hijacked by cancer. If individuals aren’t compromised does cancer still kill? Is cancer prognosis a facet of health?
Tumour profiling & characterisation
Encyclopaedic mapping of your cancer’s wiring, its genetics, mutations, cytoskeletal, DNA, RNA, molecular & metabolic features. A lot about genotype, a lot about phenotypes. A lot.
Mainstream treatment support
Wholly supporting the crucial work of your oncologists. Can treatments be less eventful / more successful / actually tolerable with more health?
Extensive individual mapping & profiling
Unparalleled typing of your ‘omics’ including genomics, metabolomics, microbiome, proteomics…. Organ systems. Body systems. Signalling systems. And everything.
Onco-immunology
Capitalising on 30+ years of groundbreaking R&D for optimising anti-cancer immunity, we’re interested in the individual’s own backdrop & the environment it creates.
Psycho-neuroendoimmunology
PEONIITM – our proprietary world-leading insights into the complex science of PNEI, & unique ability to use it. It’s all about stress-related facets of disease & health, including the biological (& mental) stress imposed on an individual by cancer. It changes everything. So does it deter normalcy in cancer?
We’re interested in how elements, interactions & communications in cancer impair normalcy.

You’re not static and neither are we.

ARC ParadigmTM
Is there a whole other dimension to engage?
The past few decades have seen an exponential rise in our appreciation of how cancer cells differ from normal cells. Increasing numbers of TARGETED PRECISION MEDICINES have been developed which have greatly added to the options available for cancer treatments. These use as targets, unique molecular properties of cancer.
IMMUNOTHERAPY meanwhile, looks to exploit mechanisms by which the body's immune system can attack and eliminate cancer cells.
ARC
The ARC Paradigm® is focused on something quite different. We are interested in features of NORMALCY that are lost in cancer that might be regained. The postulation is that these facets of normal-ness may affect the operational 'milieu' of a cancer and the environment in which immunotherapy, and an individual's immunology more widely, can work.
Through the CCRT's RSII™ Initiative, we first look to create new insights that can yield new knowledge, from which new avenues for clinical options might hypothetically eventually be generated. But not until we know what the 'right questions' would even be!
At this very initial stage, via the CCRT's RSII™ Initiative, we are undertaking a process of divergent thinking about facets of health that might be supported, tested and mapped in an individual, in the context of cancer. And developing ever more questions about what these might, perhaps, mean to the individual's ability to fight cancer, survive and, may be, live with cancer. Which may be important given that 1 in 2 of us can expect to develop cancer during our lifetimes.
Is there an optimal way to 'be successful' with cancer, through health?
RSII
Because this Initiative is about creating new Intelligence, it follows our own RSII™ Algorithms and Protocols, in which we undertake an elaborate and extensive process of reconnaissance, surveillance and interrogation.
INSERT image: reconnaissance
Reconnaissance
Ascertaining the lay of the land.
A preliminary survey to gain pertinent information, especially an exploratory survey of enemy territory. Reconnaissance collects information, or confirms or disproves the accuracy of insights or suspicions previously gained. The intent is to avoid enemy contact and accomplish its tactical task without engaging in close combat.
INSERT image: surveillance photo
Surveillance
Watching the signaling.
The duty or function of watching or guarding, for the sake of proper direction. Scrutiny to eventually attain 'superintendence'.
INSERT image: interrogation photo
Interrogation
Questioning the implications.
The process of asking many questions for a long time in order to gain information.
ARC Thesis®
Will there ever be a time when we can make cancers lose the hallmark features that make them cancer, and simply become more normal? How best can we consider what might indeed one day make normalcy more possible, more probable? We can start by working out how to create a focus and framework for what must, most importantly, be normal, in any given individual who has cancer.

Childhood cancer research trust charitable objects
To relieve sickness and to preserve and protect health for the public benefit by
PROVIDING FUNDING FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER RESEARCH PROJECTS PRINCIPALLY IN THE UK IN ORDER TO 
IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER SUFFERERS BY FINDING SAFER AND MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS AT A FASTER RATE.
Strategic process
The Childhood Cancer Research Trust invites participants to support the CCRT RSII Initiative by both
•	financing the Initiative (Programme Funding) and
•	donating the data collected
The Initiative strives to support health and identify what could make for more normalcy in the context of cancer. Although the Participant Programmes do not offer proven benefits, the Childhood Cancer Research Trust believes that the generous funding of the Initiative by participants and donated data will contribute immeasurably to New Knowledge Creation from which we can assess, validate and disseminate improved treatments for children with cancer.

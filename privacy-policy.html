                    <p>We collect and process personal data about users in the EU only when we have a legal basis for doing so under Article 6 of the GDPR.</p>
                    
                    <p>We rely on the following legal bases to collect and process the personal data of users in the UK/EU:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Users have provided their consent to the processing of their data for one or more specific purposes; and</li>

                    <p>While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of data infringement when using the internet. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="feature-title">YOUR RIGHTS AS A USER</h3>
